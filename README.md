Abiquo API Jython client
========================

This project groups  a collection of examples of the Abiquo Cloud
Platform API, using Jython as a wrapper to the official Java client.


Building
---------

The only required step to build the Jython client is to configure
the classpath properly with all necessary dependencies. To do so,
you can just run:

    mvn compile

This will generate a *lib* directory with all needed dependencies and a
*CLASSPATH* file containing the CLASSPATH variable needed to run the Jython
client.

Once the classpath has been generated, you can run the Jython code by invoking
the wrapper script as follows:

    sh wrapper.sh            # To run all examples
    sh wrapper.sh clean      # To cleanup all data generated by the examples
    
You can customize the data being generated by editing the **src/constants.py** file.
